# Projects 

## Unified-Automation-Template

- Unified Automation Template is a modular automation framework built on top of the [Pickleib](https://github.com/egecansen/Pickleib){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} library.
- This template is designed to provide a unified solution for Web UI, Mobile UI, and API automation.
- Multi-Platform Testing: Supports Web UI, Mobile UI, and API automation.
- Scenario Tagging: Enables running specific test scenarios using tags.
- Customizable Driver Selection: Defaults to Chrome for Web UI, with the option to choose other drivers.
- Headless Execution: Supports headless mode via configuration.

## Simplified-Automation-Template

- This project is a template project that includes UI & API interactions.
- The Web-UI part of the project is based on Selenium & Cucumber and the API part is based on Okhttp & Retrofit.
- The CommonSteps class stores the generic UI steps and saves us from the repeated code. 
- The ObjectRepository class is used for storing the page object instances; the page objects are automatically instantiated when the element of that page is interacted with. 
- The PageObject class is for overwriting Selenium's default field decorator to be able to use WebComponents.
- You can find the cucumber test reports under the reports directory in resources folder. After the run is completed you can find the generated results in the target directory under the reports folder.

## Appium-Springboot-Template

- This project is a automation testing framework built with JUnit 5, Appium, and Spring Boot, designed to support mobile automation.
- Project is designed for CI/CD integration using Jenkins and Docker. All dependencies are installed inside the Jenkins container automatically. 
- UI automation follows the Page Object Model for clarity and maintainability.
- API tests use a custom library layered on Retrofit & OkHttp for seamless integration and request handling.
- The project uses a Maven multi-module layout, where tests and post-report are sibling modules under a common parent.
- Reports are generated via Maven Surefire. The HTML report can be emailed by providing credentials and setting the send-report-email property to true.

## Open-Source Project Contributions

- ***[Pickleib](https://github.com/egecansen/Pickleib){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}***
  - Improved documentation, added new methods, property configurations and scalability for future upgrades.
  - A MongoDB database was created containing methods and documentation of the Pickleib library. 
  - Added chat support functionality. This feature leverages the OpenAI API and MongoDB Atlas API services along with the GPT utilities library. By seamlessly integrating chatGPT with the MongoDB database, the chat support feature provides a dynamic and engaging environment for users. This allows them to get support and retrieve method information and application examples from the Pickleib library.

- ***[Wasapi](https://github.com/egecansen/wasapi){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}***
  - Wasapi is a lightweight, Java-based API utility library that simplifies HTTP service generation and API calls using Retrofit. It abstracts the boilerplate needed to set up and use APIs, making it easier to integrate network calls in your Java applications.
  - Dockerized a MongoDB backend to support isolated unit testing, making it ideal for modern CI pipelines.

- ***[GPT-Utilities](https://github.com/egecansen/GPT-Utilities){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}***
  - This library utilizes the OpenAI API service to provide inner GPT functionality for Java projects.
  - It offers various features such as chat support, data generation, and more, which can be seamlessly integrated into any Java project.
  - I established the initial framework and set up the foundation for API usage. Additionally, I provided support throughout the development process.

- ***[Java-Utilities](https://github.com/egecansen/Java-Utilities){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}***
  - To clarify usage I create documentation, specify additional descriptions and ensure that it is comprehensive and effortless for users to understand.
  - Added new methods to the library. These enhancements aimed to extend the functionality and practicality of the Java Utilities library and to provide end users with more alternatives and efficiencies when working with Java applications.
